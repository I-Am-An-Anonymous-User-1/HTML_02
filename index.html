  <p>This is my little corner of the internet where I share my thoughts about Minecraft and share the projects I’m working on with the world. Here you’ll find builds I’m proud of, experiments I’m trying, and ideas I’m thinking about. My Minecraft username is Carly Andyko, I mainly play on Mogswamp's Flatnet, and this is my story, one block at a time. </p>

  <p>Minecraft is one of my favourite ways to connect with others, </p>
