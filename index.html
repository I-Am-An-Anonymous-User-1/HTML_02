  <p>This is my little corner of the internet where I share my thoughts about Minecraft and share the projects I’m working on with the world. Here you’ll find builds I’m proud of, experiments I’m trying, and ideas I’m thinking about. My Minecraft username is Carly Andyko, I mainly play on Mogswamp's Flatnet, and this is my story, one block at a time. </p>

  <p>My main goal is to share my passion for Minecraft and document as many things as I can. I do not want this to be just my personal project though; I want to eventually grow a team. And I will always keep the website add-free, just like Wikipedia, because I'm not here for profit. If I do ever start making profit from this site, I will donate 50% of it to charity, excluding donations to the site. </p>

  <h1>Current Projects</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>Rewriting the <a href="History_Of_Minecraft.html">History of Minecraft</a> page because the original text (which was heavily modified by me) is from ChatGPT and could use a rewrite</li>
    <li>Completing the <a href="Issues_Of_Minecraft.html">Issues of Minecraft</a> page</li>
    <li>Making the navbar stay at the top of the browser, not the page, and making general improvements to it</li>
    <li>Adding an About page</li>
    <li>Adding a Contact Us page (maybe near the end of 2026)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Also, I need a new computer, but for some reason, right when I need it most, memory prices have skyrocketed. Think, almost $1,000 DOLLARS for 64 GB of good memory. Thanks greedy companies for taking all the RAM for your AI data centres and leaving almost none in the consumer market. And its not even the AI's fault, its the greedy corporate companies' fault. </p>
