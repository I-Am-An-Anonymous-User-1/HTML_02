  <p style="margin: 0%">Minecraft is one of the most popular and influential video games in history. First released in 2011 by Mojang Studios, it has since become a global phenomenon, selling hundreds of millions of copies across multiple platforms. What makes Minecraft unique is its open-ended design, blocky graphics, and endless creative possibilities. <span class="P2">Yes, text, I agree with you.</span> AH! You scared me! Who are you? <span class="P2">Just move on. </span></p>

  <h1>The Origins of Minecraft</h1>

  <p>The game was created by Notch, also known as Markus Persson, a Swedish programmer who wanted to design a sandbox game that encouraged creativity and exploration. <span class="P2">Wow, not everyone knows Notch's real name, Mr. Text. I'm impressed.</span> Of course I know!! I'm literally explaining the history of Minecraft. <span class="P2">Yeah, makes sense now that I think about it.</span> Anyway, he drew inspiration from earlier games such as <span style="font-weight: 1000">"Infiniminer"</span> and <span style="font-weight: 1000">"Dwarf Fortress"</span> but added his own twist: a simple, blocky world that could be reshaped by the player. Ea--<span class="P2">Wow, text, I didn't even know that, and I know a lot about Minecraft.</span> Can you stop interrupting me? Who are you anyway? Anyw--<span class="P2">Well, since you asked, I am Caesar Aldaksa, also known as the Minecraft Java Edition player Carly_Andyko.</span> Who cares! Anyway, early versions of Minecraft quickly gained attention online, and the game grew steadily in popularity until it became an international success. <span class="P2">That is correct, text.</span> I know, Caesar. By the way, my name is Mr. Minecraft Text. <span class="P2">Ok Mr. Minecraft Text. </span></p>

  <h1>Game Modes</h1>

  <h2>Minecraft offers several game modes, each catering to different play styles: </h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Survival Mode, where players gather resources, manage hunger, and defend themselves against enemies like zombies and skeletons. </li>

    <li>Creative Mode, which provides unlimited resources for building without the risk of danger. <span class="P2">Mr. Minecraft Text, you forgot to mention that you can fly in creative mode!</span> Oh, right. Wait, how did I miss that? Anyway... </li>

    <li>Adventure Mode, designed for player-made maps and challenges. <span class="P2">Actually, that is outdated information. There are much better ways and tools to make maps now, and adventure mode is just a random mostly useless and forgotten thing that is just a challenge.</span> Wow, you know your Minecraft. </li>

    <li>Spectator Mode, allowing players to fly through blocks, see clearly underground, and diagnose and debug farms and builds they make. </li>
  </ol>

  <p style="text-indent: 0%">These modes give Minecraft enormous flexibility, making it appealing to casual players, builders, storytellers, and adventurers alike. <span class="P2">And people who take the game too seriously. </span></p>

  <h1>Gameplay and Mechanics</h1>

  <p>At its core, Minecraft is about interacting with blocks. Players can mine resources, craft tools, and build structures. The crafting system allows for the creation of thousands of different items, from simple wooden tools to complex machinery powered by redstone, a material that acts like an electrical circuit--<span class="P2">but not realistic and with a lot of quirks and weird accidental and intentional features such as Quasi-Connectivity! I love redstone.</span> Ahem. The day-night--<span class="P2">detoctors--I mean detectors!</span> ...AHEM! The day-night cycle adds challenge, as monsters spawn at night, encouraging players to seek shelter or prepare defenses. <span class="P2">a.k.a. Build a dirt wall because that works.</span> I wish it didn't so people would actually build good stuff!! <span class="P2">Don't worry, people do actually build good stuff. </span>Phew. </p>

  <h1>The Creative Community</h1>

  <p>One of Minecraft’s greatest strengths is it's community. Players around the world have used the game as a platform to create incredible works of art, architecture, and storytelling. <span class="P2">And lots more!!! I could go on a 100-paragraph tangent, but I need to finish my coding assignment. But I will say, I attempted to build a model of one of my future inventions in Minecraft.</span> Wait, am I your coding assignment?? <span class="P2">Yes.</span> Ok... um... some builders replicate real-world landmarks, while others design sprawling fantasy cities. The modding community has also extended the game with custom content, adding everything from new creatures to advanced technologies--<span class="P2">and optimization mods since Minecraft Java Edition is horribly optimized out of the box... also, I could go on a 200-paragraph long tangent about this, but I'm not going to. </span>Good. I don't want to wait here forever. <span class="P2">And just so you know, I am writing a 10-paragraph essay about how horrible Telus is... nostly as a joke. That is how dedicated against Telus I am.</span> Wow, what did they do to you???? <span class="P2">A lot of things. Swiftly moving on; </span></p>

  <h1>Minecraft's Versions</h1>

  <h2>Minecraft has many different versions, including: </h2>

  <h2>Minecraft: Java Edition</h2>

  <p>Minecraft Java Edition is the first ever version of Minecraft. Minecraft was always coded in Java--<span class="P2">and I think it is the best version. It is the origional, and it doesn't have marketplace items everywhere and has WAAAAAAAY less bugs than Bedrock Edition. It also has many features that Bedrock doesn't have, like the offhand, the Sweeping Edge enchant, item tooltims, and how could anyone forget, the F3 screen. The only problem is that it's horribly optimized! Mojang Studios, players shouldn't have to rely on other people making mods for the SOUL PURPOSE of optimizing your game just so they can play it properly on their computer--and mind you, you don't even allow those people to charge money for the mods they work hard on! More on Bedrock edition in the next 2 paragraphs.</span> Ahem... also, in the Minecraft Launcher, you can choose which version of Minecraft Java Edition you want. </p>

  <h2>Minecraft: Bedrock Edition</h2>

  <p>Mojang wanted the playerbase to be able to play on all different platforms, and their solution was making a Minecraft version for every platform. But since each platform has it's own version, they are incompatible with each other, spliting the playerbase, especially because Minecraft Java Edition only works on computers. So near the end of 2011, Minecraft Bedrock Edition, also known as Minecraft Bugrock edition, was made, now being the main platform for non-PC users, although you can still play it on PC. <span class="P2">And I have opinions on it, which I will now be telling you. Bugrock Edition is very glitchy, especially with determining the location of the player. For example, if you are playing on a server, the server will think you've just jumped to your death, but your client tells it "No, I am here," and from a different player's perspective, you look like you jumped, then teleported up a few blocks, to the location that your client says you are at. Basically, when the client engages their elytra, the server doesn't realize and calculates their position as if they jumped, then, when you hit the ground, you die. Even though there are glitches like this and many, MANY others, I feel like Mojang is trying to make this the main version of Minecraft. There are no cool maps made for Java that Mojang talks about. They only talk about maps on the Bedrock Marketplace. It feels like they are trying to make Minecraft Bedrock Edition the main version. Mojang, if you dare give another hint of anything bad happening to Java Edition... expect multiple lawsuits in your mailbox. You are already being sued for Breech of your own Contract and for many other ways you are breaking the law, and people will not hesitate to sue you. You are walking on thin ice--the community is sick of you.</span> Wow, that turned dark quickly. </p>

  <h2>Minecraft: Story Mode</h2>

  <p>Near the end of 2015, Minecraft Story Mode was made as a collaboration between Mojang and Telltale Games. It was an interactive adventure game, where you could make choices that affect the story as you go along. The main focus is how The Order of The Stone claimed they defeated the ender dragon, but really, they used a command block to teleport it away, and Ivor knew this and wanted to show it to the world. He researched a monster called the Wither Storm and obtained all of the materials to summon it, then summoned it during the EnderCon event when Gabriel from The Order of The Stone was on stage. Gabriel failed to defeat the wither storm, and when Ivor told it to retreat, it ignored him. He knew this was always a posibility, so he made a special potion that can kill it. Unfortunately, the potion was stolen by Jesse, the player, and the wither storm was not able to be killed and was destroying the entire world! Unfortunately, Telltale Games went bankrupt after 3 million copies were sold, and now it is one of the most sought after games. <span class="P2">Fun fact: I own an Xbox 360 and have a season pass disc for Minecraft Story Mode, but because Microsoft unfortunately shut down the Xbox 360 marketplace before I could download the remaining seasons, I only have access to season 1. Luckily, I know a friend with a PC copy of Story Mode and will get given a copy of the file, therefore, I will have access to the full game (hopefully), and I plan on reviving it.</span> Wow, how many projects are you taking on?? <span class="P2">Too many. </span></p>

  <h2>Minecraft: Education Edition</h2>

  <p>Minecraft has found a home in classrooms through Minecraft: Education Edition. Teachers use it to teach subjects like mathematics, history, computer programming, and teamwork. <span class="P2">Sorry to break it to you, but most schools just allow you to use it as a game during lunch or free time, not as a fun way of learning, and I'm actually glad about this because Minecraft Education Edition has a dirty secret: it uses the Minecraft Bedrock Edition code, which is also known as Minecraft Bugrock Edition because it is too buggy for me to almost ever consider playing on it. You can even access some of the features from Education Edition in Bedrock Edition. And I know what you are going to say about the game encouraging problem-solving, collaboration, and creativity, but sadly, that is not what it is used for.</span> I'll just let that be the explanation, even though it is mostly hating on Minecraft, because sadly, it seems pretty accurate to reality. <span class="P2">And I do want to mention that sometimes I get carried away hating on Minecraft Bedrock Edition, but the real solution is for Mojang to improve and care about BOTH Minecraft Bedrock AND Java Edition.</span> That is right. And I really wish they actually do that. Wait, we went on a tangent! <span class="P2">Yes, we did! We both digress! </span></p>

  <h1>Cultural Impact</h1>

  <p>Minecraft has influenced popular culture in countless ways. YouTube and Twitch are filled with Minecraft videos, ranging from Let’s Plays to tutorials and roleplay series--<span class="P2">you are not ending your sentence there, are you? Because there is also hardcore world series, 100 days videos, redstone creations, multiplayer, and more!</span> Yes, again, you are more knowledgabe in a lot of areas than me. I think this is outdated too: popular YouTubers such as StampyLongHead, CaptainSparklez, and Dream have built massive followings through Minecraft content. <span class="P2">Yes, that is outdated! Stampy and CaptainSparklez were most popular long ago, but now we have YouTubers such as Rekrap2, SB737, Wunba, Mogswamp, and some redstone YouTubers like Mumbo Jumbo, Purplers, CraftyMasterman, and a lot more!</span> Good thing you're here. The game has also inspired novels, merchandise, and even a planned movie. <span class="P2">A PLANNED MOVIE??? He HA! The movie has been out for HALF A YEAR OR SO, and they are on the SECOND movie by now. Sorry I'm angry, but still!!</span> Oh. </p>

  <h1>Updates and Expansions</h1>

  <p>Over the years, Minecraft has continued to evolve through regular updates. New biomes, creatures, and gameplay mechanics are introduced frequently, keeping the experience fresh. Expansions such as The Nether Update and The Caves and Cliffs Update have dramatically expanded the possibilities for exploration. <span class="P2">I'm going to stop you right there! You are very outdated! In the past year, we had updates such as Tails and Trails, Tricky Trials, Bundles of Bravery, Chase the skies, and also, Minecraft has now entered The Copper Age! Also, Totems of Undying were added in The Exploration Update, a.k.a. 1.11, which was released near the end of 2016, and this is outdated news, but it gets a mention because it is a really important moment for Minecraft. A lot of people think it ruined the game a bit... and some people take the game way too seriously and would fight you for the rest of your life about how they DID ruin the game, but I think they did NOT. I'll include a picture at the end of this paragraph. </span> Well, you know a lot more than me, so I'm just going to stop talking for this paragraph. </p>

  <img src="Totem of Undying.png" width="12.5%">

  <h1>Multiplayer and Servers</h1>

  <p>Minecraft’s multiplayer mode--<span class="P2">IT'S NOT A MODE!</span> Ok, ok, but it allows players to join servers and collaborate or compete with others. Servers can be simple survival worlds or complex custom creations with minigames, roleplaying scenarios, and competitive challenges. Some servers, like Hypixel, attract millions of players with their unique content. Multiplayer has helped sustain Minecraft’s popularity for over a decade. <span class="P2">And my favourite multiplayer server is Mogswamp's server, The Flatnet! And now that you have read this text, you are obligated to JOIN THE FLATNET! Don't worry, it's awesome! Oh, you are also obligated to JOIN THE MOGSWAMP REPUBLIC!!</span> Oh dear, here we go... <span class="P2">I'm kidding of course. </span></p>

  <h1>Why Minecraft is Special</h1>

  <h2>There are many reasons why Minecraft stands out: </h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Its blocky graphics are simple yet timeless. </li>

    <li>The gameplay encourages creativity and experimentation. <span class="P2">Minecraft players are some of the most creative people in history, and yes, I AM saying that with confidence because I know it is true. </span></li>

    <li>It appeals to players of all ages, from young children to adults--<span class="P2">but the playerbase is mostly adults if I remember correctly. </span></li>

    <li>The community creates endless new content. <span class="P2">And that description is barely enough, but I don't want to go on another tangent. </span></li>

    <li>It works as both a game and a creative platform. </li>
  </ol>

  <h1>The Legacy of Minecraft</h1>

  <p>As one of the best-selling games in history, Minecraft has left a permanent mark on gaming history. It showed that a simple idea, when executed well, can become a cultural powerhouse. It has also inspired countless other sandbox and crafting games--<span class="P2">a.k.a. COPYCATS of Minecraft.</span> Yes, which is kind of a negative thing. More importantly, it has given millions of players a space to imagine, build, and share. <span class="P2">And I can relate to that. I am really passionate about Minecraft.</span> I can tell. </p>

  <h1>Looking to the Future</h1>

  <p>With ongoing updates, a massive community, and strong support from Microsoft (which acquired Mojang, the company that owns and updates Minecraft, in 2014), Minecraft is likely to--<span class="P2">WILL</span> remain popular for years to come. Whether as an educational tool, or not I guess because some people just grief random servers, a creative outlet, or a social platform, Minecraft represents the boundless potential of games to shape culture and connect people. </p>
