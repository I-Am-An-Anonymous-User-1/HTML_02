    <h1 style="margin-top: 0px">The Issues of Minecraft</h1>

    <p>Before everyone explodes with anger, Minecraft is a great game that we all love, and I am only trying to bring attention to these issues so they can be fixed; I am not hating on Minecraft. I am giving constructive criticism and feedback. And since Minecraft will be a 2 decade old game in less than 5 years, you will probably need some backstory, and therefore, I recommend you read at least the first 2 paragraphs of <a href="History_Of_Minecraft.html">The History of Minecraft</a> page. Now, I'm still writing this part, so most of the headings will have no information under them. Rest assured, I will update this page as frequently as possible. So, let's talk about the issues of Minecraft: </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Java Edition Performance</li>
      <li>Account Migrations</li>
      <li>The Minecraft Lawsuit!</li>
      <li>And more that I may discuss in the future</li>
    </ol>

    <p style="text-indent: 0%">Yep, that's a pretty big list of pretty big issues, but nevertheless, it needs to be adressed. Let's go into more detail. NOTE, I lowered the amount of items on the list because this is my coding assignment and it is taking too long. I will re-add the sections later and keep working on them because I will work on this website as my personal project once I have time. </p>

    <h1>Minecraft Java Edition Performance</h1>

    <p>Minecraft Java Edition was, and still is, one of the most horribly optimized games. Servers, like 2Builders2Tools (2B2T, the oldest anarchy server in all of Minecraft), run on some of the best available hardware and still have many measures to prevent lag, yet, they still have issues. There are 2 main reasons for this: </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0%">1. Minecraft's code is just not very efficient</p> 

    <p>I do not know how to code in the Java programming language, let alone an expert at it, so I cannot understand the code myself. But there are plenty of mods that make the game less laggy, with notable examples such as Sodium, Lithium, Phosphor and Optifine for old versions of Minecraft, Entity Culling, FerriteCore, Dynamic FPS, and plenty more! I cannot believe that we have reached the point where Minecraft is so horribly optimized there's about 5 or 6 very well known mods just for optimization! Mojang, fix your game! </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0%">2. Minecraft can only take advantage of 1 CPU thread</p>

    <p>Now, I'm no expert in this topic and am writing this based on the information I found from others. Most of the numbers in my examples are assumptios just for demonstration purposes, and so are the examples themselves. I will cite my sources, but I have to re-find them, which I will do later. Anyway, here are the basics: </p>
    
    <p style="margin-top: -0.5em">Minecraft updates a world 20 times a second. This is known as the tick rate. When a tick happens, Minecraft needs to do a bunch of checks and make updates to the world, like is that block you just placed a wet sponge? It is. Are you in the nether? Yes. Since both of those are true, it schedules the water to evaporate from the wet sponge on the next tick, turning it back into a regular sponge. There are a LOT of these checks... tens of thousands. Lets assume it does 50,000 per tick. Now, your computer has a CPU, which has multiple threads. Lets assume it has 8, and lets assume it takes 1 microsecond to do 1 calculation. Minecraft does all of it's calculations in 1 thread, except for some edge cases like when stained glass is placed on top of a beacon, but lets ignore those to keep things simple. Since we assume Minecraft does 50,000 calculations every tick, and it takes 1 microsecond to do 1 calculation, it would take about 50 milliseconds to do those calculations. That seems pretty fast, but for big Minecraft servers, since there are multiple players, those calculations can add up and cause lag. A LOT of it. Lets assue it needs to do 1 million calculations now. That would take the server a full second to update the world once, and remember, it's supposed to update the server 20 times a second, which means, it would be 20 times slower than what it should be. And keep in mind, on anarchy servers, people often build lag machines. This makes hosting Minecraft servers very hard because very VERY expensive equipment is needed, potentially in the tens, hundreds, or, for really big servers like Hypixel, even MILLIONS of US Dollars!! But if Minecraft was coded to take advantage of all threads evenly and efficiently, servers would invest in equipment that has potentially hundreds of threads, which means those millions of calculations that took an entire second before can now be done in milliseconds, potentially microseconds, eliminating lag (for the most part because there are always edge cases) and allowing us to have servers that can potentially have thousands of players on at the same time. </p>

    <p style="margin-top: -0.5em">You might be thinking, maybe there's some mod that will save the day and allow Minecraft to take advantage of multiple threads. There are 2 likely possibilities: no such mod exists because Minecraft has hundreds of thousands of lines of code and many different versions, or that magical mod does exist, but has so many drawbacks that nearly no one uses it. The only people who can fix this is Mojang Studios, buuuuuuut they have shown in many ways that they do not care about the Minecraft community in a lot of these scenarios. Like in the Account Migrations and The Minecraft Lawsuit sections down below. </p>

    <h1>Account Migrations</h1>

    <p>As I mentioned in the <a href="History_Of_Minecraft.html">History of Minecraft</a> page, Notch didn't like all the attention he was getting from Minecraft, so he sold it to Microsoft. Prior to this, if you wanted to play Minecraft, you had to make a Mojang account. But since a multi-trillion dollar greedy company is now in control, they made everyone migrate to a Microsoft account. Quick question, you know Google? Another multi-trillion dollar greedy company. Before they bought YouTube, you had to make a YouTube account, and they did the same thing as Microsoft: migrating accounts. But unlike Microsoft, if you, somehow, for some absurd reason in the existance of this universe, have one of the legacy YouTube accounts from before May 2009, <span style="font-weight: 1000">the exact same month and year Minecraft itself was invented by Notch</span>, you can still, <span style="font-weight: 1000">to this day</span>, migrate to a Google account. How about your Mojang account? Well, all Mojang accounts that were not migrated were deleted forever, resulting in potentially millions of people losing access to the game, and although there was a 90 day period for people who didn't migrate their accounts to claim new accounts, many people didn't get notified and only found out years later... <span style="font-weight: 1000">and got absolutely no refund</span>. SalC1 has a great video on this topic, which you should watch <a href="https://youtu.be/rUFDRAEducI?si=Vy_n0IqBk8aWX8s0" target="_blank">here</a>. Also, notice how in the video, he says that you have to agree to both Mojang's EULA and Microsoft's Terms of Service, which a lot of people didn't realize and he said that part of the EULA only shows up in the Nintendo URL. Almost certainly a sneaky move by Mojang and Microsoft. What SalC1 didn't catch is that Mojang, according to their own EULA, were not allowed to delete your account, so they <span style="font-weight: 1000">sneakily updated it without telling ANYONE to ALLOW themselves to delete your account.</span> This is Breach of Contract, which I will go over in The Minecraft Lawsuit section below. Furthermore, when contacting Mojang, they would not answer questions and automatically close most tickets to do with account migrations, and when asking Microsoft, they would apparently investigate themselves and find nothing wrong, and if you ask them to site the contract for where it says that you needs to migrate, Microsoft says that the EULA is constantly updated and to refer to the most recent one, even if you didn't agree to the most recent one because they didn't tell you they are updating it and didn't ask if you agree, and if that's the case, they just lie and say that the most recent EULA applies to all users, refuse to answer any more questions, and immediately close the ticket. This is, again, Breach of Contract. They also force you to agree to the Microsoft Services Agreement and Xbox Software License Agreement when you migrate, on top of the previously mentioned EULA and Microsoft Terms of Service. These are not the only illegal things they did/still do though. Check The Minecraft Lawsuit section for more information. </p>

    <h1>The Minecraft Lawsuit</h1>

    <p><span style="font-weight: 1000; color: rgb(255, 0, 0)">Keep in mind, I am not a lawyer.</span><span style="font-weight: 1000"> This is only my interpretation of the situation and I may be wrong. Take this information with a grain of salt. I got most of my information from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KianBrose" target="_blank">Kian Brose's YouTube channel</a>. Visit his <a href="https://youtu.be/C5RvoPQZQeM?si=Uz4MkcAcCXtmNjNf" target="_blank">first</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/w_UF_4gZclI?si=V1QnuGuoKNWl6ziZ" target="_blank">second</a> videos on this topic for more accurate information. </span></p>

    <h2>How It Started</h2>

    <p>Minecraft is a game where anyone can add anything they want, even if it wasn't part of Minecraft. And since you can add anything you want, Kian decided to re-create a gun game called MC-War that he used to play as a child, which unfortunately got shut down. After months of development, an excited community, and thousands of dollars spent, he finally set a release date for the server; but the next day, Mojang Enforcement, the part of Mojang that enforces their Terms of Service, started threatening to shut down other servers with guns because they decided to reinterpret their rules and now consider guns as not OK, and therefore, will start shutting down servers with guns. A group with all of these servers' owners, including Kian, was created to discuss and negotiate, asking valid questions such as "Why do servers that have had guns for well over a decade that had no issues suddenly prohibited <span style="font-weight: 1000">and</span> with very short notice?" and "Why, in the UNIVERSE of grassy diamond creeper cake, is it OK for Mojang to have guns in their own marketplace where they get a 30% cut (last time I checked) when we can't?" There are thousands of games with guns meant for children, and Minecraft has explosive crossbows you can make using Bomb O' Sparkles, the name of Firework Rockets if you use the Pirate Speak language! That crossbow is considered a firearm in the US, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Norway, Poland, <span style="font-weight: 1000">and even where Mojang's headquarters is, Sweden</span>, and <span style="font-weight: 1000">MORE!</span> How about <span style="font-weight: 1000">GUN</span>powder and <span style="font-weight: 1000">BOMBS</span> a.k.a. <span style="font-weight: 1000">TNT</span>? Those even naturally generate in some structures! After asking for more answers again, Kian and everyone else were told that the key decisionmakers were on vacation and they would get a reply once they got back. It's not like it will take months, right? Nope, it took <span style="font-weight: 1000">6 MONTHS! Half a YEAR!</span> In the meantime, Kian didn't know whether to continue to invest in development and marketing... because it's UNREASONABLE to make that decision when the existence of his entire project is based on a CEO's decision after they come back from their vacation! And after the 6 months, they got told that even though this is not a final decision, guns are OK for now, which is a different way of saying "We will be changing our minds later, we just can't afford any more bad press right now because this entire thing has hit the news and gotten much of the community to be angry at us for being a greedy, dishonest, unreasonable corporate machine." ...but it gets worse. </p>

    <h2>Why This Is Illegal</h2>

    <p>Kian is smart and is not letting Mojang get away with this, so in the 6 months Mojang took to reply, he investigated whether this entire fiasco is illegal, and OH LORD this entire fiasco is illegal; for many reasons. </p>
    
    <p style="margin-top: -0.5em">First, when Mojang reinterpreted their rules, they didn't write it in the End User License Agreement (EULA) or any other guidelines they referred to, therefore invalidating the reinterpretation as it was not in a legally binding document you have to agree to, and because this reinterpretation is hidden, they can change their minds whenever they want... which they did. <span style="font-weight: 1000">3 times</span>. </p>

    <p style="margin-top: -0.5em">Next, since Mojang's End User License Agreement a.k.a. the EULA is what you have to agree to when you buy Minecraft, and since it is a legally binding agreement/contract, you have to follow whatever it says. In some countries like the US, companies can put anything in their contracts like "You can't sue us... because we said so," however, Mojang is a Swedish company, and Sweden is in Europe, so Mojang has to follow Europe's Consumer Protection Laws and Contract Laws. Those laws state things like contracts must be fair and cannot have things such as a get-out clause, hidden terms, one sided changes to a contract, one sided changes to a product or service, and/or one sided interpretation of a contract, and Mojang has most, if not all of these in their contracts, completely voiding them. Furthermore, Mojang referred to the Mojang Brand Guidelines, which Kian could not find and assumed it didn't exist, but in his second video, he found out that it does exist, but it's hidden from the public, and is the document where Mojang allows gambling, ranks, and other junk. And to put the cherry on top, if something is loosely worded, the consumer a.k.a. Kian is the one who gets to choose how to interpret it, not Mojang. </p>

    <p style="margin-top: -0.5em">Furthermore, Kian tried to solve this problem by collecting all of the information and sending it to news outlets, creating backlash that Mojang couldn't ignore. But of course, they just ignored it. And not just that. Because in the 6 months that Mojang took to reply, they did 2 really bad things; first, and this was in the second video, they partnered with <span style="font-weight: 1000">Nerf, the TOY GUN company, even though their own guidelines say that GUN-LIKE TOYS are forbidden,</span> and second, they updated the EULA, didn't notify anyone about it, and therefore, didn't get anyone's agreement for it, which is called Breach of Contract, and, you guessed it, is <span style="font-weight: 1000">illegal; AND they released it at the same time as a snapshot and put all of their effort into announcing that to cover it up.</span> So Kian analyzed the contract, collected all of the stupid parts, to put it mildly, and forwarded the information to basically everyone again. But this time, it got so bad that Mojang sent information to a handful of creators with a heads up and some information to clear up the confusion, which Kian did not share likely due to legal reasons. Worse, the creators that were reached out to were forced to sign non-disclosure agreements, forbidding them from giving up any of the information they were sent, <span style="font-weight: 1000">information that should have been publicly available by law in the EULA or other contracts/guidelines.</span> Even worse, in Kian's second video, he found out that out of the <span style="font-weight: 1000">47 times</span> Mojang changed their legal agreements, they <span style="font-weight: 1000">never told anyone about it.</span> Kian knows this because he went through <span style="font-weight: 1000">thousands of archived pages</span> for <span style="font-weight: 1000">every legal agreement Mojang has EVER HAD</span> to see if a <span style="font-weight: 1000">single word had changed</span>, because the non-corporate translation of their own words is <span style="font-weight: 1000">"Frick you, we are not telling you when we change our contracts and guidelines, you have to check back and find out yourself." </span></p>

    <h2>How Mojang Allows Gambling</h2>

    <p>In the EULA, it is specifically stated TWICE that gambling, violence, terrorism, or other unsafe content is strictly banned, which makes sense... except for that the gambling part is a complete LIE because just like for guns, there are hidden rules that allow crates and crate keys, with extremely similar tactics such as real casinos to get people addicted and turn a profit, with the hidden rules being in the Mojang Brand Guidelines. This is why <span style="font-weight: 1000">thousands, TENS of thousands, or even MORE young kids got gambling addictions</span>, and Kian knows this because in his research he talked to many of them. It is absolutely terrible and inhumane. And they are doing this <span style="font-weight: 1000">as a Swedish company where their own government has some of the STRICTIST LAWS in the WORLD for gambling</span>, completely <span style="font-weight: 1000">banning anyone and everyone under 18 from gambling at all</span>, and Mojang just <span style="font-weight: 1000">ALLOWS IT!!!!</span> And there's so much more, like how they are <span style="font-weight: 1000">forcing</span> developers onto the Bedrock Marketplace so they can charge <span style="font-weight: 1000">extremely exorbitant fees</span>; <span class="P2">as if that doesn't sound like some company that was recently hit with billions of dollars in fine from Europe, cough, Apple, cough. </span> <span style="font-weight: 1000">WHAT IF SOMEONE WANTS TO MAKE MODS FOR JAVA EDITION, MOJANG?????</span> So what is the solution? A lawsuit. </p>

    <h2>The Class Action Lawsuit</h2>

    <p>So how do you sue a multi-billion dollar company owned by a multi-trillion dollar company? You need lawyers, but unfortunately, lawyers are very expensive. Think $400 an HOUR! And Kian is, unfortunately, legally poor to the point that he has to live in a basement filled with radioactive gas. I am completely serious. If you have not watched his videos, go do that. So how can he get lawyers? Well, Europe is supposed to have competent governments, so when someone has a right guaranteed by the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, like in Article 38, Consumer Protection, if that person is too poor, according to Article 47, they have the right to get help from the government, and Sweden does this through the Legal Aid Institution, and according to their own website, that person is entitled to 100 hours of legal aid, unless otherwise determined by a court, but that's always just a couple extra hours to finish the case. Keep that in mind. When a lawyer is working with a client that has Legal Aid, they have to reduce their hourly rate to sometimes 25% of what they would normally charge, so most of the lawyers Kian contacted refused to take the case, and the ones that were willing to were inexperienced, which is not fair. Furthermore, this case is so complex that it is way longer than the 100 hours you are given, and as I said before, the Legal Aid Institution only gives a few extra hours. But the Legal Aid Institution is overseen by 2 more organizations, JO and JK, so Kian reached out to them, and they basically said "Gambling in Minecraft and not being compliant with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights is not important enough, we don't care." Next, Kian reached out to Consumer Protection Agency, KO, which is supposed to represent you if you cannot represent yourself and the case is considered important enough, and again, they basically said the exact same thing as JO and JK. Next, the National Board of Consumer Complaints, ARN, and in short, they also failed. All 5 of Sweden's governmental institutions failed to uphold justice and Article 47 and the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been violated by the entire country of Sweden. If Mojang gets away with this, they are setting the precedent for the future. It is no longer about Kian and his project, it is about <span style="font-weight: 1000">the entirety of the Minecraft community</span>, Java and Bedrock, and you know you messed up bad when both Java and Bedrock players are all on the same side. So Kian started a Gofundme crowdfunding campaign to attempt to get enough money to pay for lawyers. And it succeeded. It was able to raise <span style="font-weight: 1000">$150,000 in a FEW DAYS!</span> Now Kian has access to legal representation and is <span style="font-weight: 1000">suing Mojang in a class action lawsuit on behalf of the Minecraft community. Once and for all. </span></p>

    <p style="margin-top: -0.5em">A major role in Minecraft's success is the community making it into what it is with things like mods, maps, plugins, texture packs, open source optimizations (read the Minecraft Java Edition Performance section, and recently, there have also been performance issues with Bedrock Edition as well), servers, community events, and videos, and all of these things are <span style="font-weight: 1000">now being threatened.</span> Mojang, there's a <span style="font-weight: 1000">limit</span> to how much of your <span style="font-weight: 1000">corporate junk</span> we are willing to take, <span style="font-weight: 1000">and you crossed it in multiple categories and on multiple levels. We, as a community, are not begging anymore. This is a class action lawsuit that you cannot ignore.</span> Kian's objectives are quite simple: revert the account migration, comply with contract and consumer protection laws, remove uninforceable clauses, CLEARLY indicate when changes happen, and comply with the terms of old players' old contracts. <span style="font-weight: 1000">Kian, may justice be with you.</span> But there is one more thing. </p>

    <h2>The People Who Actually Care</h2>

    <p>There are plenty of people at Mojang that work very hard and are very creative, including the sound engineers, designers, programmers, and plenty more; thousands of people. The issue is the evil people who only care about profit and don't even play the game they work for, and Microsoft. Those are the people that need to act more reasonably and fairly and follow the law. The creative people, unfortunately, are the ones that get told what to do by the evil people, and their work is diminished or ruined by the evil people (or that's my theory anyway). To those who care, on behalf of the Minecraft community, thank you. Thank you for caring about Minecraft and trying your best. Although there are many issues with Minecraft, it would have been much worse without your hard work. Keep doing the awesome things you do. </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0px">Hmm... at this point, I'm thinking of writing a book about each company and all of the thing they have done wrong. Maybe I'll do that as a side project in my free time. </p>
