    <h1 style="margin-top: 0px">The Issues of Minecraft</h1>

    <p>Before everyone explodes with anger, Minecraft is a great game that we all love, and I am only trying to bring attention to these issues so they can be fixed; I am not hating on Minecraft. And since Minecraft is a 16 year old game, you will probably need some backstory, and therefore, I recommend you read at least the first 2 paragraphs of <a href="History_Of_Minecraft.html">The History of Minecraft</a> page. Now, I'm still writing this part, so most of the headings will have no information under them. Rest assured, I will update this page constantly. So, let's talk about the issues of Minecraft: </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Java Edition Performance</li>
      <li>Bedrock Edition Featured Servers!</li>
      <li>Account Migrations</li>
      <li>The Minecraft Lawsuit!</li>
      <li>And more that I may discuss in the future</li>
    </ol>

    <p style="text-indent: 0%">Yep, that's a pretty big list of pretty big issues, but nevertheless, it needs to be adressed. Let's go into more detail. NOTE, I was not able to update my site for a while due to a glitch with GitHub, the service I use to host my site. Some sections are incomplete, but I need to update the site. Also, I lowered the amount of items on the list because this is my coding assignment and it is taking too long. It is already a month overdue. I will re-add the sections later and keep working on them because I will work on this website as my personal project once I have time. </p>

    <h1>Java Edition Performance</h1>

    <p>Minecraft Java Edition was, and still is, one of the most horribly optimized games. Servers, like 2Builders2Tools (2B2T, the oldest anarchy server in all of Minecraft), run on some of the best available hardware and still have many measures to preven+++*t lag, yet, they still have issues. There are 2 main reasons for this: </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0%">1. Minecraft's code is just not very efficient</p> 

    <p>I do not know Java, let alone an expert at it, so I cannot understand the code myself. But there are plenty of mods that make the game less laggy, with notable examples such as Sodium, Lithium, Phosphor, Entity Culling, Dynamic FPS, and plenty and plenty more! I cannot believe that we have reached the point where Minecraft is so horribly optimized there's about 5 or 6 very well known mods just for optimization! Mojang, fix your game! </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0%">2. Minecraft can only take advantage of 1 CPU thread</p>

    <p>Now, I'm no expert in this topic and am writing this based on the information I found from others. Most of the numbers in my explanation are assumptios just for demonstration purposes. I will cite my sources, but I have to re-find them, which I will do later. Anyway, here are the basics: </p>
    
    <p style="margin-top: -0.75em">Minecraft updates a world 20 times a second. This is known as the tick rate. When a tick happens, Minecraft needs to do a bunch of checks and make updates to the world, like is that block you just placed a wet sponge? It is. Are you in the nether? Yes. Since both of those are true, it remembers to evaporate the water from wet sponge, turning it back into a regular sponge, on the next tick. There are a LOT of these checks... tens of thousands. Lets assume it does 50,000 per tick. Now, your computer has a CPU, which has multiple threads. Lets assume it has 8, and lets assume it takes 1 microsecond to do 1 calculation. Minecraft does all of it's calculations in 1 thread, except for some edge cases like when stained glass is placed on top of a beacon, but lets ignore those to keep things simple. Since we assume Minecraft does 50,000 calculations ecery tick, and it takes 1 microsecond to do 1 calculation, it would take about 50 milliseconds to do those calculations. That's seems pretty fast, but for big Minecraft servers, since there are multiple players, those calculations can add up and cause lag. A LOT of it. Lets assue it needs to do 1 million calculations now. That would take the server a full second to update the server once, and remember, it's supposed to update the server 20 times a second, which means, it would be 20 times slower than what it should be. And keep in mind, on anarchy servers, people often build lag machines. This makes hosting Minecraft servers very hard because very VERY expensive equipment is needed, potentially in the tens, hundreds, or, for really big servers like Hypixel, even MILLIONS of US Dollars!! But if Minecraft was coded to take advantage of all threads, servers would invest in equipment that has potentially hundreds of threads, which means those millions of calculations that took an entire second before can now be done in milliseconds, potentially microseconds, eliminating lag (for the most part because there are always edge cases) and allowing us to have servers that can potentially have thousands of players on at the same time. </p>

    <p style="margin-top: -0.75em">You might be thinking, maybe there's some mod that will save the day and allow Minecraft to take advantage of multiple threads. There are 2 possibilities: no such mod exists because Minecraft has hundreds of thousands of lines of code and many different versions, or that magical mod does exist, but has so many drawbacks that nearly no one uses it. The only people who can fix this is Mojang Studios, buuuuuuut they have shown in many ways that they do not care about the Minecraft community in a lot of these scenarios. </p>

    <h1>Bedrock Editon Featured Servers</h1>

    <p>Minecraft Bedrock Edition has something called featured servers. Featured servers are servers that are partnered with Microsoft and appear for Bedrock players. The pro</p>

    <h1>Account Migrations</h1>

    <p>As I mentioned in the History of Minecraft page, Notch didn't like all the attention he was getting from Minecraft, so he sold it to Microsoft. Prior to this, if you wanted to play Minecraft, you had to make a Mojang account. But since a multi-trillion dollar greedy company is now in control, they made everyone migrate to a Microsoft account. Quick question, you know Google? Another multi-trillion dollar greedy company. Before they bought YouTube, you had to make a YouTube account, and they did the same thing as Microsoft: migrating accounts. But unlike Microsoft, if you, somehow, for some absurd reason in the existance of this universe, have one of the legacy YouTube accounts from before May 2009, the same month and year Minecraft itself was invented by Notch, you can still, to this day, migrate to a Google account. How about your Mojang account? Well, all Mojang accounts that were not migrated were deleted forever, resulting in potentially millions of people losing access to the game, and although there was a 90 day period for people who didn't migrate their accounts to claim new accounts, many people only found out years later and got no refund. SalC1 has a great video on this topic, which you should watch <a href="https://youtu.be/rUFDRAEducI?si=Vy_n0IqBk8aWX8s0">here</a>. Also, notice how in the video, he says that you have to agree to both Mojang's EULA and Microsoft's Terms of Service, which a lot of people didn't realize because it was almost certainly a sneaky move by Microsoft to get more legal leverage, and he said that part of the EULA only shows up in the Nintendo URL. Keep that in mind. In fact, keep all of the account migration fiasco in mind. It will come up in the next section. </p>

    <h1>The Minecrat Lawsuit</h1>

    <p><span style="font-weight: 1000; color: rgb(255, 0, 0)">Keep in mind, I am not a lawyer, nor has a lawyer reviewed the following.</span> <span style="font-weight: 1000">This is only my interpretation of the situation and I may be wrong. Take this information with a grain of salt. I got most of my information from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KianBrose" target="_blank">Kian Brose's YouTube channel</a>. Visit his first video and second video on this topic for more accurate information. </span></p>

    <p style="margin-top: -0.75em">Mojang is getting sued for Breach of Contract, breaking Sweedish and European laws, and much more. Here's how it started: Minecraft is a game where anyone can add anything they want, even if it wasn't part of Minecraft. And since you can add anything you want, Kian Brose decided to re-create a gun game called MC-War that he used to play when he was a kid, which unfortunately got shut down. After months of development, an excited community, and thousands of dollars spent, he finally set a release date for the server; but the next day, Mojang Enforcement, the part of Mojang that inforces their Terms of Service, started threatening to shut down other servers with guns because they decided to reinterpret their rules and now consider guns as not OK, and therefore, will start shutting down servers with guns. A group with all of these servers' owners, including Kian, was created to discuss and negotiate, asking valid questions such as "Why do servers that have had guns for well over a decade that had no issues suddenly prohibited with very short notice?" and "Why, in the UNIVERSE of grassy creeper cake, is it OK for Mojang to have guns in their own marketplace where they get a 30% cut (last time I checked) when we can't?" Its not like there are thousands of games with guns meant for children, and its not like Minecraft has explosive crossbows you can make using Bomb O' Sparkles, the name of Firework Rockets if you use the Pirate Speak language! That crossbow is considered a firearm in the US, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Norway, Poland, and even where Mojang's headquarters is, Sweeden, and MORE! How about GUNpowder and BOMBS (TNT)? Those even naturally generate in some structures! After asking for more answers again, you were told that the key decisionmakers were on vacation and they would get a reply once they got back. It's not like it will take months. 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6 MONTHS! That's how long it took for Mojang to reply! In the meantime, Kian didn't know whether to continue to invest in development and marketing when the existance of your entire project is based on a CEO's decision after they come back form their vacation! And after the 6 months, they got told that even though this is not a final decision, guns are OK for now, which is a different way of saying "We will be changing our minds later, we just can't afford any more bad press right now because this entire thing has hit the news and gotten much of the community to be angry at us for being a greedy, dishonest, unreasonable corporate machine." ...but it get worse. </p>

    <p style="margin-top: -0.75em">Kian is smart and will not let Mojang get away with something like this, so in the 6 months Mojang took to reply, he investigated whether this entire fiasco is illegal, and it is; for many reasons. </p>
    
    <p style="margin-top: -0.75em">First, when they reinterpreted their rules, they didn't write it in the End User Lisence Agreement (EULA) or any other guidelines they referred, therefore invalidating the reinterpretation as it was not clearly communicated and is not written anywhere, which also allows them to change their minds whenever they want... which they did. 3 times. </p>

    <p style="margin-top: -0.75em">Next, Mojang's End User Lisence Agreement, otherwise known as the EULA, is what you have to agree to when you buy a Minecraft account. This is a legally binding agreement/contract, and unlike some countries like the US where companies can put anything in their contracts like "You can't sue us... because we said so," Mojang is a Sweedish company, and because Sweeden is in Europe, Mojang has to follow Europe's Consumer Protection Laws and Contract Laws. Those laws state that contracts must be fair and cannot have things such as a get-out clause, hidden terms, one sided changes to a contract, one sided changes to a product or service, and/or one sided interpretation of the contract, and Mojang has most, if not all, of these in their contracts, completely voiding them and, <span style="font-weight: 1000">if I understand correctly, and this is the part that I am least confident about,</span> binding you to the last actually legal contract that you agreed to, or, for more recent players like myself who have not agreed to any old contracts, effectively nullifying any contract with Mojang, other than the Microsoft Terms of Service, if that one is even legal. I am most likely wrong but it is still a possibility. </p>
