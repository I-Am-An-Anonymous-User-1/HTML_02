    <h1>The Issues of Minecraft</h1>

    <p>Before everyone explodes with anger, Minecraft is a great game that we all love, and I am only trying to bring attention to these issues so they can be fixed; I am not hating on Minecraft. And since Minecraft is a 16 year old game, you will probably need some backstory, and therefore, I recommend you read at least the first 2 paragraphs of <a href="History_Of_Minecraft.html">The History of Minecraft</a> page. Now, I'm still writing this part, so most of the headings will have no information under them. Rest assured, I will update this page constantly. So, let's talk about the issues of Minecraft: </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0%">Yep, that's a pretty big list of pretty big issues, but nevertheless, it needs to be adressed. Let's go into more detail. </p>

    <h1>Java Edition Performance</h1>

    <h1>Bedrock Edition Marketplace</h1>

    <h1>Bedrock Editon Featured Servers</h1>

    <h1>Bedrock Edition Bugs</h1>

    <h1>The Mob Vote</h1>

    <h1>Account Migrations</h1>

    <p>As I mentioned in the History of Minecraft page, Notch didn't like all the attention he was getting from Minecraft, so he sold it to Microsoft. Prior to this, if you wanted to play Minecraft, you had to make a Mojang account. But since a multi-trillion dollar greedy company was now in control, they made everyone migrate to a Microsoft account. Now, you know Google? Another multi-trillion dollar greedy company. Before they bought YouTube, you had to make a YouTube account, and they did the same thing as Microsoft: migrating accounts. But unlike Microsoft, if you, somehow, for some absurd reason in the existance of this universe, have one of the legacy YouTube accounts from before May 2009, the same month and year Minecraft itself was invented by Notch, you can still, to this day, migrate to a Google account. How about your Mojang account? Well, all Mojang accounts that were not migrated were deleted forever, resulting in potentially millions of people losing access to the game, and although there was a 90 day period for people who didn't migrate their accounts to claim new accounts, many people only found out years later and got no refund. CalC1 has a great video on this topic, which you can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/rUFDRAEducI?si=Vy_n0IqBk8aWX8s0">here</a>. Also, notice how in the video, he says that you have to agree to both Mojang's EULA and Microsoft's Terms of Service, which a lot of people didn't realize because it was almost certainly a sneaky move by Microsoft to get more legal leverage, and he said that part of the EULA only shows up in the Nintendo URL. Keep that in mind. In fact, keep all of the account migration fiasco in mind. It will come up in the breech of contract and law issue. </p>
